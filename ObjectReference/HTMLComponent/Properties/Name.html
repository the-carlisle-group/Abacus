However, the <code>Name</code> should be unique within some meaningful context. For example, some dialog component might have a number of text input components in it. These text inputs should all have different names. But you might have multiple instances of the dialog component up at once, and thus the document as a whole will have duplicate <code>Name</code> values, which is fine.  </p></main></body></html>
