This is in contrast to JavaScript, which makes a distinction between the document and the root html element. Therefore, every method or property that applies to HTMLElement may be applied to HTMLDocument.  </p><p>However, some methods and properties apply only to the HTMLDocument object, and these are documented here.    </p></main></body></html>
