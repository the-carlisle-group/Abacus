# DataGrid Object

The `DataGrid` object is a high-performance component for viewing and editing
tabular data. 


## What it is Not

The `DataGrid` is not a general purpose grid for presentation purposes.
It does not offer different sized rows, or fonts, or headers that span multiple columns,
or tree-like behavior.
