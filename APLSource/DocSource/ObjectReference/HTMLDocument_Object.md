# HTMLDocument Object

The HTMLDocument object (often referered to simply as the document object)
is simply the root HTMLElement object whose tag is `html`. This is in contrast to
JavaScript, which makes a distinction between the document and the root html
element. Therefore, every method or property that applies to HTMLElement may be applied to
HTMLDocument.  

However, some methods and properties apply only to the HTMLDocument object, and these
are documented here.
