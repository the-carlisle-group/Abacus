# DataGrid DeleteColumns Property

Boolean scalar. Allow or disallow column deletion. The default is `1`.

This property only applies if ReadOnly is `0`.
If ReadOnly is `1`, columns may not be deleted.

The [DataGridColumn]() provides a [CanDelete]() property for
determining if specific columns may be deleted or not.
