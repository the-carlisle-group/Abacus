# DataGrid Object

## Description

A high-performance component for viewing and editing tabular data.

## Commentary

The `DataGrid` provides for high-performance viewing and editing of tables large and small.

The `DataGrid` is not a general purpose grid for presentation purposes.
It does not offer different sized rows, or fonts, or headers that span multiple columns,
or tree-like behavior.
