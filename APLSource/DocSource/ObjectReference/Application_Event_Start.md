# Application Start Event

This event occurs after the [Build]() event has occurred and the web page constructed,
and after a websocket connection has been established.

Attaching a callback function to this event allows the initial state of the application
to be set dynamically using all of the tools of Abacus, rather than in just static
HTML.
