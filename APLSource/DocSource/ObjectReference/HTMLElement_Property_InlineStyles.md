# HTMLElement InlineStyles Property

The `InlineStyles` property is two-column matrix of CSS
properties and values.

Inline styles are also implicit properties of the HTMLElement object,
where they must be prepended with an underscore, and dashes substituted for
underscores.

Inline styles specified directly take precedence over
same-named styles in the `InlineStyles` property.
