# TextInput Object

## Description

A labelled text input.

## Commentary

In addition to providing a label, the TextInput
component provides an optional button via the [Picker]() event.
This is typically used for launching a form to aid in filling out
the input.  For example, the [FileInput]() object
is built with the `TextInput` object, providing a button
to browse the file system and pick a file name.
