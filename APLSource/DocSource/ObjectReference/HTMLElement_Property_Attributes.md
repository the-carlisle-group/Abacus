# HTMLElement Attributes Property

The `Attributes` property is a 2 column matrix of 
attribute names and values.

Attributes are also implicit properties of the HTMLElement object
and may be defined with the [New]() function.
They may also be specified by direct assignment.
In either of these latter cases,
dashes should be replaced with underscores.

Attributes specified by directly take precedence over
same-named attributes in the `Attributes` property.
